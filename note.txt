## app folder
In Next.js, the "app" folder has a special significance as it is used to define the top-level
layout and behavior for your application. The contents of the "app" folder are used to customize
the default App component provided by Next.js, which wraps around all other components and pages
in your application. This allows you to add global styles, context providers, and perform other
tasks that should be applied across all pages.

# layout.js
It is the root of our app. A root layout is the top-most layout in the root app directory.
It is used to define the <html> and <body> tags and other globally shared UI.

Layout components should accept and use a children prop. During rendering, children will be
populated with the route segments the layout is wrapping.

# page.js
A page is UI that is unique to a route. You can define pages by exporting a component
from a page.js file. Use nested folders to define a route and a page.js file to make
the route publicly accessible.

## How to create pages and navigation
> Create a folder inside app folder naming as the page name you want. i,e, about, product
> Create a file naming page.js inside the folder. i,e, about > page.js

## Public folder
Public folder is for to keep and use static assets in our app.

## Styling in next js
There are two types of system for styling
module based style: those styles which we will use in a specific page or module or component, we will write those styles in page.module.css file.

global style: those styles which we will use in our entire app, we will write those styles in globall.css file.

The system of using our styles from global style file and module based style file are different.

writing module based style css:
write css in page.module.css file by maintaining cammel case. i,e, .myText{color:green}
import styles from page.module.css
use css like this: className={ styles.myText }

## Rendering client side & Server side
client side rendering: If we want to build a component or page which we want render
in client side, then we need to write 'use client' at the top of the page. All the
hooks in ract js is for client side render purpose.

server side rendering: by default in next js is server side rendering. react js hook
won't work in server side render component.

## next.config.js file
The next.config.js is a configuration file used in Next.js applications to customize
the behavior of the Next.js build system. It is a regular Node.js module that exports
an object containing various configuration options.

## .next
Once the project is launched, .next folder will be created to store page cache and
some features to speed up your project. While project running, some files will be
added to .next folder during your dev usage.
